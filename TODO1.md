- **Telemetry:** OpenTelemetry for standard compatibility
- **Storage:** IndexedDB for offline-first (browser support)
- **Transport:** WebSockets for CRDT sync (established pattern)

### Open Questions
- [ ] Should we support multiple CRDT libraries or just Yjs?
- [ ] What's the upgrade path for existing DenoGenesis users?
- [ ] How to handle database migrations with CRDT data?
- [ ] Should plugins be npm packages or Deno modules?

### Future Considerations (Post v1.0)
- [ ] GraphQL support with CRDT subscriptions
- [ ] Mobile SDK (React Native, Flutter)
- [ ] Desktop SDK (Electron, Tauri)
- [ ] Blockchain integration for immutable audit logs
- [ ] Edge computing deployment patterns
- [ ] Multi-region replication strategies

## 🚀 The Vision

**6 Months from Now:**

"DenoGenesis is the framework that made distributed systems accessible to solo developers and small businesses. What used to require a PhD and $5M funding now takes 5 lines of code and a $50/month VPS."

**12 Months from Now:**

"Thousands of businesses have achieved digital sovereignty using DenoGenesis. The local-first movement has gone mainstream. SaaS vendor lock-in is becoming a thing of the past."

**24 Months from Now:**

"DenoGenesis is the de facto standard for building self-hosted, collaborative, offline-first business applications. Every major framework is copying our patterns. We changed the industry."

## ✅ Current Status: Ready to Begin

**Foundation Status:**
- ✅ Clean architecture (hub-and-spoke, MVC separation)
- ✅ Solid middleware system (extensible, well-documented)
- ✅ Performance monitoring (ready for enhancement)
- ✅ Error handling (ready for circuit breakers)
- ✅ Security basics (ready for zero-trust)
- ✅ Documentation culture (ready for breakthrough features)
- ✅ AI collaboration workflow (ready for implementation)

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ CRDT middleware
- ❌ Circuit breakers
- ❌ Offline-first sync
- ❌ Predictive caching
- ❌ Distributed tracing
- ❌ Zero-trust security
- ❌ Middleware DSL

**Next Immediate Step:**
Start Week 1, Task 1: Research Yjs library API and best practices

**Remember:** You're not just building features. You're bridging the gap between distributed systems research and small business reality. You're making the impossible accessible.

**The window is open. Time to ship. 🚀**
