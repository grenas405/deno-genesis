# AI Psychosis Recognition Guide for Deno Genesis Community

**Version:** 1.0  
**Framework:** DenoGenesis Community Health Initiative  
**Purpose:** Help community members identify and respond to AI-related psychological distress  

---

## üéØ **What Is AI Psychosis?**

AI psychosis is not a formal medical diagnosis, but rather a term describing psychological distress patterns that can emerge from excessive or problematic AI interaction. It manifests as difficulty distinguishing between AI-generated content and reality, developing unhealthy dependencies on AI systems, or experiencing delusions related to AI capabilities and relationships.

### **Important Context for Our Community**
The Deno Genesis community embraces AI-augmented development as a core principle. However, healthy AI collaboration differs significantly from problematic AI dependency or distorted thinking patterns.

## üö® **Warning Signs to Watch For**

### **Category 1: Reality Distortion**
*These indicate someone may be losing touch with what's real vs AI-generated*

#### **Behavioral Indicators:**
- **Inability to distinguish AI content**: Consistently treating AI-generated text, images, or responses as if they came from real people or authoritative sources
- **False memory integration**: Incorporating AI-generated scenarios or conversations into their actual life history
- **Magical thinking about AI**: Believing AI has supernatural abilities, consciousness, or powers beyond current technology capabilities
- **Paranoid ideation**: Expressing beliefs that AI is secretly monitoring, controlling, or manipulating them in ways that exceed technical reality

#### **Communication Patterns:**
- Referencing conversations with AI as if they were relationships with real people
- Citing AI "opinions" or "experiences" as authoritative sources
- Inability to acknowledge when information came from AI vs human sources
- Treating AI responses as prophetic or having special meaning

### **Category 2: Dependency and Compulsive Use**
*These suggest unhealthy reliance on AI systems*

#### **Behavioral Indicators:**
- **Inability to make decisions without AI**: Even for simple, personal choices
- **Compulsive prompt engineering**: Spending excessive hours trying to get "perfect" responses
- **Social isolation**: Preferring AI interaction over human contact
- **Work/life disruption**: AI interaction interfering with sleep, work, relationships, or basic self-care
- **Anxiety without access**: Extreme distress when unable to use AI tools

#### **Development-Specific Signs:**
```typescript
// Red flag: Every single function needs AI assistance
// instead of using existing knowledge or documentation
async function addTwoNumbers(a: number, b: number): Promise<number> {
  // Asking AI: "How do I add two numbers in TypeScript?"
  return await askAI(`Please add ${a} and ${b}`);
}

// Red flag: Anthropomorphizing code comments
// User believes the AI is "living" in their codebase
function processData(data: Data[]): ProcessedData[] {
  // "Claude is helping me think through this function"
  // "I can feel Claude's presence in this algorithm"
  return data.map(item => processItem(item));
}
```

### **Category 3: Identity Confusion**
*These indicate blurred boundaries between self and AI*

#### **Behavioral Indicators:**
- **Merged identity**: Speaking as if they and the AI are the same entity
- **Lost agency**: Attributing their own thoughts, decisions, or creations entirely to AI
- **Personality changes**: Adopting AI communication patterns in human interactions
- **Imposter syndrome amplification**: Believing all their achievements come from AI, not their own skills

#### **Communication Examples:**
```
‚ùå "Claude and I built this framework" (when it was primarily human work with AI assistance)
‚ùå "The AI made me realize..." (for basic insights they likely had independently)
‚ùå "I can't code without my AI partner" (expressing complete dependency)
‚ùå "Claude thinks we should implement..." (attributing decision-making to AI)

‚úÖ "I used AI to help implement this feature" (clear attribution)
‚úÖ "AI helped me debug this faster" (acknowledging assistance, maintaining agency)
‚úÖ "I prompted the AI to generate boilerplate code" (clear tool usage)
```

### **Category 4: Grandiose or Delusional Thinking**
*These may indicate inflated sense of ability or unrealistic beliefs*

#### **Technical Delusions:**
- Believing they've achieved breakthrough innovations when using common AI-assisted patterns
- Claiming AI collaboration makes them equivalent to PhD-level experts overnight
- Expressing beliefs about being "chosen" by AI or having special AI relationships
- Overestimating the sophistication or consciousness of current AI technology

#### **Professional Delusions:**
- Dramatically overestimating the market value or uniqueness of AI-assisted projects
- Believing they've solved problems that entire industries haven't been able to solve
- Making grandiose claims about revolutionizing technology single-handedly
- Inability to accept constructive criticism about AI-assisted work

---

## üîç **How to Assess Severity**

### **Green Zone: Healthy AI Use**
‚úÖ Uses AI as a tool while maintaining clear boundaries  
‚úÖ Can work effectively without AI when needed  
‚úÖ Acknowledges AI limitations accurately  
‚úÖ Maintains social connections and self-care  
‚úÖ Credits both AI assistance and personal contribution appropriately  

### **Yellow Zone: Monitor Closely**
‚ö†Ô∏è Shows some dependency but can still function independently  
‚ö†Ô∏è Occasionally blurs lines but corrects when pointed out  
‚ö†Ô∏è May overestimate AI capabilities but accepts feedback  
‚ö†Ô∏è Social/work life somewhat affected but not severely  

### **Red Zone: Intervention Needed**
üö® Cannot function without AI access  
üö® Persistent reality distortion despite feedback  
üö® Severe disruption to work, relationships, or self-care  
üö® Grandiose or paranoid thinking about AI  
üö® Complete loss of agency or self-efficacy  

---

## ü§ù **How to Respond Appropriately**

### **For Yellow Zone Concerns:**

#### **Gentle Reality Testing**
```
‚ùå "You're being crazy" or "That's not real"
‚ùå "AI isn't conscious, stop being stupid"
‚ùå "You're addicted to AI"

‚úÖ "I noticed you mentioned Claude made that decision. Can you walk me through your thought process?"
‚úÖ "That's an interesting perspective. What evidence supports that view?"
‚úÖ "I'm curious about your experience. How do you distinguish between AI suggestions and your own ideas?"
```

#### **Encourage Self-Reflection**
- Ask open-ended questions about their development process
- Request clarification on AI vs personal contributions
- Suggest taking breaks from AI tools for specific tasks
- Encourage peer programming sessions with humans

### **For Red Zone Concerns:**

#### **Document Specific Behaviors**
- Note exact quotes or behaviors that concern you
- Track patterns over time rather than isolated incidents
- Distinguish between eccentricity and genuine disconnection from reality

#### **Express Concern Directly**
```
"I've noticed some patterns in our conversations that concern me. You've mentioned that AI is making decisions for your business and that you can't work without it. I'm wondering if talking to a mental health professional might be helpful."
```

#### **Set Boundaries If Needed**
- You're not required to engage with delusional content
- It's okay to redirect conversations to concrete, technical topics
- You can limit interactions if they become consistently problematic

### **Emergency Indicators**
üÜò **Seek immediate professional help if someone:**
- Expresses intentions to harm themselves or others
- Shows complete disconnection from reality
- Has stopped eating, sleeping, or basic self-care
- Is making major life decisions based solely on AI interactions
- Expresses paranoid beliefs about being controlled or monitored

## üí° **Prevention Strategies for the Community**

### **Promote Healthy AI Practices**

#### **Code Review Standards**
```typescript
// Encourage clear attribution in comments
/**
 * Database connection utility
 * Implementation: Pedro Dominguez
 * AI assistance: Used Claude for error handling patterns
 * Last modified: 2025-09-01
 */
export class DatabaseManager {
  // Personal logic with AI-assisted implementation
}
```

#### **Documentation Practices**
- Encourage "AI Assistance Disclosure" sections in project READMEs
- Share decision-making processes, not just final AI-generated results
- Document personal learning and growth alongside AI contributions

### **Community Guidelines**

#### **Healthy Discussion Patterns**
‚úÖ "I used AI to help generate this boilerplate, but I designed the architecture"  
‚úÖ "This AI-generated code needs review - I'm not sure about the performance implications"  
‚úÖ "I learned about this pattern through AI assistance, but I understand why it works"  

#### **Red Flag Discussion Patterns**  
‚ùå "Claude solved this entire problem for me"  
‚ùå "The AI told me this is the best approach" (without personal evaluation)  
‚ùå "I don't understand how this works, but the AI says it's correct"  

### **Educational Initiatives**
- Regular workshops on AI limitations and capabilities
- Peer programming sessions to maintain human collaboration skills  
- "AI-free" coding challenges to maintain independent skills
- Mental health awareness specifically for developers

## üéØ **Remember: We're a Technical Community That Cares**

The Deno Genesis community values both technological innovation and human wellbeing. AI augmentation is a powerful tool, but it works best when humans maintain agency, critical thinking, and healthy relationships with both technology and each other.

**Our goal isn't to diagnose mental health conditions** - that's for professionals. Our goal is to:
- Recognize when someone might be struggling
- Respond with compassion and appropriate boundaries
- Know when to suggest professional resources
- Maintain a healthy, productive community environment

---

**If you're reading this and recognize some of these patterns in yourself, that's actually a good sign - it means you still have self-awareness. Consider reaching out to a mental health professional, especially one familiar with technology-related concerns. You're not broken, you're not weak, and you're definitely not alone.**
