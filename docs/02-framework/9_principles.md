## üåç **The Vision: Complete Digital Sovereignty**

The 9 Principles of Local-First Software provide a complete framework for achieving digital independence at every level:

- **Individuals** control their data and computing environment
- **Businesses** own their technology stack and digital destiny  
- **Communities** develop local innovation capacity and economic independence
- **Regions** achieve technological sovereignty and competitive advantage

This framework represents a fundamental shift from centralized, extraction-based technology models to distributed, creation-focused approaches that serve human flourishing rather than platform profits.

*The first 7 principles asked: "What if users controlled their data?"*  
*The final 2 principles answer: "Here's how businesses can control their technology and anyone can build these systems."*

**Together, they provide the complete roadmap from individual agency to community digital sovereignty.**
